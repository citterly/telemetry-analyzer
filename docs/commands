If you want to run just this **single smoke test file**:
pytest tests/test_session_builder_smoke.py -v

If you want to run the **specific test function** inside the file:
pytest tests/test_session_builder_smoke.py::test_canonical_export -v

If you want to run **all tests in the repo** (good for CI):
pytest -v

And if you want **live output (print statements)** to show up:
pytest -s -v
