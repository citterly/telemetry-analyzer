=== Session 1 (2025-01-29 01:00 UTC) - INITIALIZER ===
Initializer agent run.

Context:
- Project: aim-telemetry (AIM XRK telemetry analyzer)
- Platform: Linux dev + Windows extraction (DLL requires Windows)
- Prior work: Fixed Parquet extraction bug, added data viewer UI

Work completed this session:
- Created features.json with 8 features
- Created claude-progress.txt (this file)
- Created init.sh bootstrap script
- Identified existing analysis modules: gear_calculator, lap_analyzer, vehicle_config
- Found import bug in gear_calculator.py (references non-existent config_analysis)

Features defined:
1. feat-001: Fix gear_calculator imports (priority 1)
2. feat-002: XRK extraction queue (priority 2)
3. feat-003: Windows extraction API (priority 3)
4. feat-004: Shift point analysis feature (priority 4)
5. feat-005: Transmission comparison feature (priority 5)
6. feat-006: Lap analysis feature (priority 6)
7. feat-007: Session report generator (priority 7)
8. feat-008: Analysis API endpoints (priority 8)

Environment notes:
- Server runs on Linux at http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Parquet viewer at /parquet
- XRK files in data/uploads/, Parquet exports in data/exports/
- Windows extraction uses .memory/ folder for cross-machine communication

Next session should:
1. Run boot-up ritual (read this file, features.json, run init.sh)
2. Pick feat-001 (Fix gear_calculator imports) - highest priority
3. Implement and test
4. Update features.json and this log


=== Session 1 continued (2025-01-29 01:15 UTC) - CODING AGENT ===
Working on: feat-001 (Fix gear_calculator imports)

Work completed:
- Changed import in gear_calculator.py from config_analysis to vehicle_config
- Verified fix: GearCalculator now instantiates correctly
- Test: 6000 RPM @ 100 mph correctly identifies gear 3 with 0.92 confidence

Status: feat-001 marked PASSING
Features: 1/8 passing

Next priority: feat-002 (XRK extraction queue)


=== Session 1 continued (2025-01-29 01:30 UTC) ===
