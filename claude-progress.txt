3. Updated all 7 report classes to inherit BaseAnalysisReport:
   - ShiftReport, LapAnalysisReport, GearAnalysisReport, PowerAnalysisReport
   - GGAnalysisResult, CornerAnalysisResult, SessionReport

4. Added analyze_from_parquet alias on SessionReportGenerator
   - Delegates to existing generate_from_parquet() method

5. Updated __init__.py to export BaseAnalyzer and BaseAnalysisReport

6. Deferred items:
   - Class renaming (GearAnalysis->GearAnalyzer, LapAnalysis->LapAnalyzer) deferred
     because LapAnalyzer already exists in src/analysis/lap_analyzer.py - would
     create confusing name collision
   - SessionService facade deferred - larger refactor beyond cleanup scope
